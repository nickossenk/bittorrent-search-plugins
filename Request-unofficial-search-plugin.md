In qBittorrent there are two kind of search plugins:
* Official: maintained by qBittorrent developers and can be updated through qBittorrent client. You can find them [here](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/tree/master/nova3/engines).
* Unofficial: maintained by third parties. You can find them [here](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/Unofficial-search-plugins).

If you know a torrent site that is not in the official/unofficial list, you can make it yourself with [this instructions](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/How-to-write-a-search-plugin) or update the following table.

# Requested plugins

**Developers:** You could work on any plugin. It would make the person who made the request very happy. Sites in progress are already being worked on by someone. It is advisable to contact them and offer to help if you really want to work on the same site.
